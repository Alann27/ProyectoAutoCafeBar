# Gas Station Management System - ProyectoAutoCafeBar

This is a gas station management system, which allows you to manage your gas station. With this system you can keep track of the number of gallons of fuel you have, those you buy and those that are sold.

You can manually change the price of fuel or let the software update it automatically finding the price of fuels in the Dominican Republic by itself.

In this system, each fuel dispenser has two sides and each side has 4 hoses to be able to serve different fuels. Each hose shows the numbering, which is the total gallons of fuel that have been sold in that hose, so with this amount you can keep a daily record of what is sold in the business.

With this application you keep track of the employees who work in your gas station and what work they do, their salaries and the difference between the earnings they deliver each day and the actual earnings that were recorded in the software.

Earnings are automatically added to the database as are expenses, such as payroll payments. You can also add other income and place the expenses that are in your business, so that you always have the net profits of your gas station.

The reports that can be made with this application are: the movements, which groups together the income and expenses of the business; the payroll of the employees and the tables (which is the record of the numbering). These reports were made with ReportViewer, which means that you can save your reports as a Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel or .pdf file.
